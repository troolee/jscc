1. First of all you need to install Google Closure Compiler. To do so please 
follow:

Download closure-latest.zip from http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/ page:

    $ wget http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip

Create directory where you want to install closure compiler:

    $ mkdir ~/Google\ Closure
 
Unzip the archive:

    $ unzip compiler-latest.zip -d ~/Google\ Closure

Next we need to create a script to execute closure compiler as easy as possible.
Create file named "closure-compiler" in the directory where you've unpack the
archive and put the following rows to it:

    #!/bin/bash
    java -jar "$PWD/`dirname "$0"`/compiler.jar" $*

Now make it executable:

    $ chmod +x ~/Google\ Closure/closure-compiler

Create a symbolic link to the script somewere in your PATH:

    $ ln -s ~/Google\ Closure/closure-compiler ~/bin/closure-compiler
    
Now test it and if all ok you will see closure compiler's help message:
    
    $ closure-compiler --help
